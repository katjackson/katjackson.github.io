<!-- <img src="/headshot.jpg"/> -->

I am a 28-year-old junior python developer with a rapidly growing stack. I manipulate data to solve problems and am just beginning my journey in web development. I'm looking forward to working on diverse teams and learning more every day.

My endless patience and attention to detail were acquired through years of copyediting and customer service management. I love cats and television.
